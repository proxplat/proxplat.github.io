# Proxplat

This is a website hosted on Github pages that uses the offical ProPresenter API by RenewedVision to make ProPresenter usable remotely in a webbrowser
Some of its functionality maybe will be replaced by the official Propresenter control (check out renewedvision.com/propresenter/control when it comes out), but propaly not all of it.

## Use
In order to use this you need to be in the same network as the Computer running ProPresenter and have its IP and Port (can be seen in the Preferences under Networking)

## Development
This is currently work in progress and things might change at any moment.
